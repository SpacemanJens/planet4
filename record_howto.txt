run this:

cd Documents/opencv1/ && source myenv/bin/activate && pip install mss &&python3 record_screen6.py
or separate
cd Documents/opencv1/
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install mss
python3 record_screen6.py

Close the terminal to stop the recording

notes: for some reason mms that is used for recording cannot be installed permentently. We therefore activate local env and record_screen6

To install the python and opencv do something like:
brew install python
python3 --version
//If you see something like Python 3.x.x, it means Python is installed.

pip3 install --user opencv-python
or maybe
//Use a Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv myenv
pip install opencv-python
